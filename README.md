# Chess Beginner Guidebook – Learning Support Project

This repository contains source code created to support
a beginner-focused chess guidebook project.

The code was designed to help illustrate chess concepts
and support structured learning for new players—not as a polished product,
but as a reference to show how I approach learning flow and user needs.

If helpful, feel free to explore the code, but it is provided
as an optional reference rather than a complete application.

## Purpose

This project was created to support the development of
a beginner-focused chess guidebook designed for Korean-speaking learners.
It reflects my approach to structuring explanations and visual support
for chess concepts in a way that reduces learning barriers.

---

## Optional Reference

The code in this repository reflects my approach to:
- Visualizing chess ideas simply
- Supporting learning structures
- Bridging conceptual explanations and interactive logic

The content is **an optional reference** for reviewers,
not a production app or full game.

Note: The source code in this repository is provided as plain text (.txt)
and is intended as a conceptual reference rather than a production-ready implementation.
